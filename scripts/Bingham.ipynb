    "for $x\\in\\sphere{\\dim-1}$. Without loss of generality, the matrix $A \\in \\reals{\\dim\\times\\dim}$ is symmetric such that we can transform the variables into the eigenbasis of $A$. In the following, we assume that the variables underwent this transformation by letting $A = \\text{diag}(\\kappa_1, \\ldots, \\kappa_{\\dim})$ where $\\kappa_1 \\le \\kappa_2 \\le \\ldots \\le \\kappa_d$ are the eigenvalues of $A$. Because the Bingham distribution is invariant under shifts of the diagonal of $A$, i.e., invariant under $A\\mapsto A + c\\, \\mathrm{Id}_d$, where $c\\in\\reals{}$ is some constant, we can let $\\kappa_1 = 0$. The Bingham distribution is bimodal with symmetric modes at $\\pm u_{\\dim}$ where $u_{\\dim} \\in \\sphere{\\dim-1}$ is the eigenvector of $A$ with the largest eigenvalue $\\kappa_{\\dim}$. The maximal value of the logarithm of the unnormalized probability density is $\\kappa_d$, i.e., $\\max_{x\\in\\sphere{d-1}} \\log \\bing{}(x) = \\kappa_{\\dim}$.\n",

    "Various algorithms for simulating the Bingham distribution have been proposed. The algorithm by \\cite{Kent18} is particularly attractive because it uses an acceptance/rejection sampler based on the angular central Gaussian (ACG) distribution as an envelope and is therefore straightforward to implement. We use this method as a baseline against which we compare our slice samplers as well as RWMH and HMC. We run the geodesic slice samplers on the sphere (geoSSS) as well as RWMH and HMC on two high-dimensional Bingham targets with $\\dim=10$ and $\\dim=50$, respectively. For each target and sampling algorithm, we simulate the consecutive Markov chain realizations $x_1,\\dots,x_{N}$ with $N=10^5$ starting from the mode $u_{\\dim}$. To explore the variability of all MCMC algorithms, we run 10 repetitions. The step-size parameter of the RWMH and HMC algorithm is automatically tuned to achieve a reasonable average acceptance rate."
